#Principles of Programming

Ideas and concepts to help you succeed in programming

- ***Always keep program in a working state AT ALL TIMES***
- Attempt to code small additions. Don't implement too much detail or functionality
- Each idea/addition should be implemented in its own function definition
- Name functions and variables meaningfully
- If something breaks...***STOP***. Seek help or begin to debug
- It is okay to not know how to do something! Look it up

##Create Task Requirements

- **A purpose** - why did you write this application
- **A List** - a list and how it reduced complexity or how you could not write the app without one
- **A Function**
  - *Sequence* - code that runs over several lined over
  - *Selection* - if statements
  - *Iteration* - looping
  - *Parameter*- input to the function
    - This input must change the result of the function

### Parameter

What is a parameter?

```python
def function(x, y):

```

x and y in the above function definition are parameters
